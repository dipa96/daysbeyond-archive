# CVE-2021-43849

cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and simple interface for accessing fingerprint APIs. In versions prior to 5.0.1 the exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it.

## PoC (Proof of Concept)

```shell
adb shell am start -n de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric/.BiometricActivity -e "" ""
```

Expected result: App will crash
