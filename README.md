# My days and not

Analysis of vulnerabilities that I find interesting during my **Penetration Testing activities**. Including my zero-day exploits and vulnerability analysis without a public PoC.

## Analysis list

+ [CVE-2021-43849](/CVE-2021-43849/README.md) - Mobile Android - Denial of Service(DoS)

## Glossary

+ An **zero-day**, (also known as a **0-day**) is a computer-software vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network. An exploit taking advantage of a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.

+ An **N-day exploit** is an exploited vulnerability that has a patch available. This differs from zero-day exploits, which are new and awaiting patches from the compromised vendor. Understandably, newer exploits are more sought after and expensive, but these seemingly “outdated” exploits continue to circulate and grow in popularity.
