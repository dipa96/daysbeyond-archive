# My days and not

Analysis of vulnerabilities I discover during my **security audit**. Including my **zero-day** exploits and vulnerability analysis without public PoC(**N-day**).

## Glossary

+ An **zero-day**, (also known as a **0-day**) is a computer-software vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network. An exploit taking advantage of a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.

+ An **N-day exploit** is an exploited vulnerability that has a patch available. This differs from zero-day exploits, which are new and awaiting patches from the compromised vendor. Understandably, newer exploits are more sought after and expensive, but these seemingly “outdated” exploits continue to circulate and grow in popularity.
